# ADM-HW2

To solve the homework we used all the datasets from *fig.share.com* as it was indicated, in particular we used: ***players, teams, coaches, matches*** and ***events***, the last two only regarding *Premier League*, *Serie A* and *La Liga*. In different points of the homework we also changed the index of the datasets *Players* and *Teams* to make the computations easier.
